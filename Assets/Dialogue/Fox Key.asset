  - Welcome back guy.
  - Oh? You can hear me? Now I can tell someone my stories!
  - When I was adventuring through the woods one day, I saw a man enter the cave.
  - Well, I got inside and saw there was a chest.
  - So, I took the chest. I can't open it, though, so you can have whatever's inside.
  - (You found a key in the chest)
